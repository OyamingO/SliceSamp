## Installation

The code requires `python>=3.7`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

The following optional dependencies are necessary for mask post-processing, saving masks in COCO format, the example notebooks, and exporting the model in ONNX format. `jupyter` is also required to run the example notebooks.

```
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib
```

## License

The model is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).
